Ion Periodic Table
==================

These pages contain information on candidate ion species for use in
ion trap quantum computing and other atomic physics experiments. It is
originally based on pages maintained and hosted by the `Monroe
group`_ (their new version can be found `here`__).

Wavelengths are generally taken from the `NIST Atomic Spectra
Database`__ which lists air wavelengths for 200 nm < Î» < 2000 nm and
vacuum wavelengths for all others.
