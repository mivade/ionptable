Dimensionless ratios of the cross section for ionization into a continuum state of S character relative to ionization into a state of D character are extracted from data obtained in two independent experiments. We obtain the values 0.102±0.003 and 0.096±0.012, respectively, and compare these to current theoretical predictions.},
