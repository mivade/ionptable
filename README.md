Ion Trapping Periodic Table
===========================

This repository recreates the Ion Periodic Table listing ions used in
ion trapping experiments originally hosted on the
[Monroe group web page][monroe] (it has since been added back in a
slightly different form [here][newptable]). The source files for
generating energy level diagram figures can be found in the `figs`
directory. Unless you are interested in using or modifying these
figures, you probably want the [rendered pages][gh-pages] rather than
the source tree.
