Ion Periodic Table
==================

This repository recreates the Ion Periodic Table listing ions used in
ion trapping experiments once hosted on the
[Monroe group web page][monroe]. The source files for generating
energy level diagram figures can be found in the `figs`
directory. Unless you are interested in using or modifying these
figures, you probably want the [rendered pages][gh-pages] rather than
the source tree.
