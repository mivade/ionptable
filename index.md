These pages contain information on candidate ion species for use in
ion trap quantum computing and other atomic physics experiments. It is
originally based on pages maintained and hosted by the
[Monroe group](http://iontrap.umd.edu/) (their new version can be
found [here](http://iontrap.umd.edu/resources-2/periodic-table/)).

Wavelengths are generally taken from the
[NIST Atomic Spectra Database](http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/ASD/lines_form.html)
which lists air wavelengths for 200 nm < Î» < 2000 nm and vacuum
wavelengths for all others.

If you notice an error, or would like your group's page linked to from
an ion page, fork the repository, make changes, and submit a pull
request. Alternatively, email [Mike DePalatis](depalatis@phys.au.dk)
with the requested changes.

Source files for figures and this documentation can be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/mivade/ionptable).
