These pages contain information on atomic ions used in quantum optics,
quantum computing, and other atomic physics experiments. It was
originally based on pages maintained and hosted by the
[Monroe group](http://iontrap.umd.edu/) (their new version can be
found [here](http://iontrap.umd.edu/resources-2/periodic-table/)).

Wavelengths are generally taken from the
[NIST Atomic Spectra Database](http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/ASD/lines_form.html)
which lists air wavelengths for 200 nm < Î» < 2000 nm and vacuum
wavelengths for all others.

or would like your group's page linked to from an ion page, fork the
